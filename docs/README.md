# Sciquill

Sciquillhelps you write your academic grant, paper, biosketch, or CV in `markdown`.
It provides templates, style files, and helper scripts that are useful for building PDFs from `markdown`. 
This bring us closer to the goal of authoring scientific documents in markdown to completely [separate content from style](http://databio.org/posts/markdown_style.html).
